# Guide for students working with me

You are a student doing or considering doing a project with me?  Keep
reading, this document explains what I'll expect from you, what you
can expect from me, and provides inspiring references. I wish I got this
kind of document when I was a student, so I hope it will be useful to
you.

## What I expect from you

### Commitment

I expect an interest and attachment for the project you're working on,
and *dedication* to deliver quality results. This is more important for
you than for me, since this project will in part determine the rest of
your career, and life. If you aren't excited about it every morning or
if you look forward the end of the day to go have "fun" elsewhere, then
something's wrong :)

In practice, commitment also means *focus*. You should concentrate on
the task that you're on and minimize any distractions. For example,
there shouldn't be Facebook notifications popping up on your screen
while you're coding.


### Intellectual rigor

I expect rigor and an analytical mindset. For example, you should be
able to define precisely a problem that you're trying to solve and to
determine what information you need to solve that problem, and whether
you have data at your disposal that carries that information. 

If you make a claim not supported by any data, you should be able to define the
[premises](http://www.csuchico.edu/phil/sdobra_mat/claimlist.html) upon
which your claim stands. Also, you should be able to detect bogus
reasoning and fallacious claims, and you should know the main [cognitive
biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases).

When data is available, use it to make precise fact-based claims, rather
than mere qualitative assessments or guesses. For example, instead of
saying "this method is faster" you would say "this method is 2.6 times
faster than the generic one on CPU model X", or "this method runs at 123
GBps"— measure, don't speculate. Finally, strive to make any of your
results or measurements *reproducible*.

### Organization

You should know how to manage your todo list and notes in order to keep
track of tasks and to prioritize them.  Depending on the project, we may
have a shared todo list or a single issue tracker, but you should also
maintain your own todo list and notes.

Priorizing and scheduling tasks is hard— it's actually proven to be
NP-hard. I will help you, but it's important that you learn to do it by
yourself, as you'll be more immersed than me in the project. Factors to
take into consideration when prioritizing and scheduling tasks include:

* *Hardness*: How much mental and computational effort it takes to
  complete the task.
* *Latency*: How long it will take to complete the task.
* *Uncertainty*: How certain are your estimates of hardness and
  latency.
* *Criticality*: Do you need to complete this task before performing
  any other task on the project, or can it wait?
* *Motivation*: How excited and motivated are you to work on a task
   at a given time? Not an excuse to unreasonably delay boring tasks
   though ;)
* *Energy*: At what time of day are you the most efficient to perform
  the hardest tasks? For me it's early in the morning or late at night,
  so I try to schedule the tasks that need the most focus and effort
  around those times.


### Creativity

Your project will most likely include a research component.  This means
that you're not here just to execute tasks, but also
to bring your own ideas regarding the direction and execution of the
project. 
Creativity means for example finding different ways to solve a technical
problem, modifying the goals of the project to more
interesting|ambitious|original ones, or identifying a vulnerability caused
by an unexpected usage of a tool.
Creativity is also about challenging *my* ideas and, even better,
proving me wrong.

"But I'm not a creative person!"; in our context, creativity is not a
skill or a character trait, it's a mode of operation. It takes
curiosity, stubbornness, open-mindedness, and hard work. I'll refer you
to [John Cleese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j-Lz0D5_ck) for an
inspiring description of the creativity process. 


### No bullshit

"Don’t bullshit yourself or others. Apply brutal honesty and
transparency to everything you do," to quote from
[GyShiDo](http://gyshido.com/). Equip yourself with a good bullshit
detector, you'll need it if you work in information security.
Bullshit signs in information security are for example:

* The abuse of the word "cyber."
* Bad quality writing and visuals.
* The use of superlatives instead of reliable facts. For example, "our
  ultra-advanced cyber detection system performs extraordinarily to
  reach a 200% detection rate of even the most persistent cyber
  threats."
* Incorrect use of technical terms, for example confusion between
  "vulnerability", "exploit", and "malware."
* The use and abuse of buzzwords, especially when simplest terms would
  fit. For example, "secure blockchain-based deep learning". New
  buzzwords appear regularly.
* In research papers, signs that correlate positively with bullshit
  include: an unknown/low-tier university (conversely, papers from
  places such as MIT or Stanford are very rarely BS), a paper written in
  Word rather than LaTeX, a low-tier journal or conference (or no
  peer-review at all). Some of the points of the [Crackpot
  Index](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/crackpot.html) apply to
  information security as well as to physics.

If you're not sure, ask me. To learn more about bullshit, read [this
paper](http://journal.sjdm.org/15/15923a/jdm15923a.pdf).  


## What you can expect from me

### Support and availability

I'll be happy to answer your reasonable questions (see below for
details), to teach you concepts or tools related to the projects, and
more generally to have any enlightening discussion. 

I will rapidly respond to your requests or questions by email/message at
any time of day even on week-ends, unless specific event. You can call
me on my mobile phone too, but for technical discussions I prefer a
written form because it forces you to write down the question and thus
think about it. A written response also leaves a trace for further
reference ("but you told me that, look!").

That said, I'll have only limited time so make sure to make good use of
it :)


### Flexibility 

If you feel unsatisfied with the work you're doing or if you'd prefer to
do something a bit different, we'll discuss how to adapt the project to
a topic that is better for you, in terms of learning, efficiency, or
career. But that shouldn't be an excuse to avoid the most challenging
tasks.

I'll also be flexible in terms of working hours. I don't really care
about when you work nor about the number of hours you spent in front of
your computer. But I care (in this order) about your motivation, the
quality of your work, and the amount of work produced. 

You may receive emails from me at night or during week-ends, but that
does not mean that I want you to also work at those times.


### Honesty

Expect me to be honest and no-bullshit, with you and in general. I won't
tell you that an idea is good if I believe that it's not; I won't let
you work on something if I believe that you'll be wasting your time or
that you won't learn anything. 

I'll also be transparent and will share with you all information about
the project's context and expectations. Likewise, I will most probably
share parts of your work (code, advancement) with internal experts or
stakeholders for greater transparency and to receive useful feedback.


## Some specific points

### Questions

Don't be lazy: before asking me a question (such as "how to get
command-line arguments in C?"), try to find the answer by yourself first
on the usual places (Google, StackOverflow, etc.). This will teach you
how to search effectively and you'll learn additional things along the
way. I you ask me a question and in 10 seconds I find the answer on
Google's first page, then I'll feel like you're wasting my time.

However, there are questions that you *should* ask me directly, because
you won't easily/quickly find an answer online. For example, highly
technical questions such as "how secure is the implementation of AES in
OpenSSL against fault attacks?".


### Tools

Feel free to use and propose other tools than the ones I propose. I
don't care if you use emacs, vi, or MS Word to edit code as long as
you'll deliver :)

To communicate, we'll probably use Slack. It's way more convenient than
email for the kind of project we'll do. 


### Coding

The code you'll write should not only work/compile, it should also be
safe and follow the best practices and coding conventions for the
specific language you're using. You should assume that your code 
will be published and be visible to your peers and future potential
employers. 

For example, never code a dirty or unsafe workaround thinking "that's
ok since nobody will read the code". If you have to use such code, add a
comment highlighting it and justifying it.

To help get higher quality code, use static code analyzers and code
formatters. For example, pylint and pep8 for Python, gofmt for Go, and
for C(++), valgrind, flawfinder, clang-format, clang's address
sanitizer.

Last but not least, we'll use git. Make sure you're familiar with the
basic commands, in particular with the branching and merging commands
and their underlying operations. The [Git
book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is your friend. Also, we'll try to
follow best practices as long as it makes sense. For example, working on
dedicated branches to implement new features and avoid committing to
master.

### Writing

Write in English; be it reports, comments in your code, or variable names. If
like me your native language is French, online discussions on Slack or
IRC can be in French. Long emails, however, should be written in English
in order to be shared, if needed, with non-French speakers.

The learn the basics of good writing, read [*The Elements of
Style*](http://www.crockford.com/wrrrld/style.html). It's a quick and
easy read, yet a goldmine.
To further improve your English, read William Zinsser's [*On
Writing
Well*](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Well-Classic-Guide-Nonfiction/dp/0060891548/),
another classic. You'll find a PDF
[online](http://www.brynmawr.edu/math/people/anmyers/ESem/on-writing-well.pdf).


### OPSEC

We may work with sensitive information. So when needed, use Signal, use
